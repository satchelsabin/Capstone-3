# Capstone 3 Proposal

Satchel Sabin

## Idea 1
Create a model to read off and interpret receipts based on a picture. Using datasets found [here](http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=MSRA_Text_Detection_500_Database_(MSRA-TD500)) and [here](https://github.com/clovaai/cord)

## Idea 2
Create a model to detect types of noises. I'd record a couple base noises, such as piano notes claps, snaps etc and create my own dataset of random combination. Then see if I can create a model to detect which noise is which. 

## Idea 3
Create a generative model based on poetry samples, maybe also a genterative model that links poetry to generated art and music too.
